- Quorum thresholds to ensure legitimate community participation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error codes for different failure scenarios
- Proper assertion checks throughout all functions
- Graceful failure modes with informative error messages
- Transaction rollback on validation failures

## Deployment Strategy

The contracts are prepared for deployment across different environments:

1. **Development**: Local Clarinet environment for initial testing
   ```bash
   clarinet console
   ```

2. **Testnet**: Stacks testnet for integration testing
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy --network=testnet
   ```

3. **Mainnet**: Production deployment after thorough testing
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy --network=mainnet
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Election

```clarity
;; Create a municipal election
(contract-call? .voting-booth create-election
  "Municipal Election 2024"
  "Annual election for city officials"
  u1640995200  ;; start time (block height)
  u1641081600  ;; end time (block height)
)
```

### Adding Election Positions

```clarity
;; Add mayoral candidates
(contract-call? .voting-booth add-election-position
  u0  ;; election-id
  "Mayor"
  (list "Alice Johnson" "Bob Smith" "Carol Williams")
)
```

### Submitting a Community Proposal

;; Submit infrastructure proposal
(contract-call? .proposal-engine submit-proposal
  "Road Infrastructure Improvement"
  "Proposal to allocate budget for city-wide road repairs and upgrades"
  "infrastructure"

  "Allocate $5M from municipal budget for road repairs"
)
```

### Casting a Vote in Election

```clarity
;; Vote for mayor
(contract-call? .voting-booth cast-vote
